The introduction and the first post of my blog. Welcome to my world!

Greetings, my friend.

Delighted to have you here. It's intriguing to stumble upon a personal diary entry on an 'academic homepage', isn't it?  (Just to clarify, this site is powered by GitHub Pages, forked from [academicpages/academicpages.github.io](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), which originally serves as a homepage for academic research)

Well, to be honest, I'm actually just a little bit drawn to the idea of sharing my thoughts in a public space, but unlike students who focus on research and aim at pursuing a PhD, I have no intention of cluttering my homepage with extensive purely official content like CVs, research areas, publications (not that I even have those!). For me, this is more of a blog rather than a typical academic site. Here, you will discover my everyday diary, thoughts, ideas, and internal debates within myself and with others, alongside some formal elements of introduction and current status in terms of work or studies. 

So, without further ado, let's dive right in.
