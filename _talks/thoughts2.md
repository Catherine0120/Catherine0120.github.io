Here is the summary of thoughts during my summer at Hong Kong, approximately from June to August 2024.

1. Taking a shower is truly a moment when creativity soars. I had the idea to start a club. Members would regularly share something — a feeling, concept, or abstract thought — that can't be fully captured by any single Chinese word. The club would be called "Say Beyond Words." The goal is to address how fleeting concepts or emotions, which lack corresponding words, are difficult to remember, express, or communicate. Our thinking is often limited by language.

2. I said, "Forget about finding a man. I’ve realized that loving a city is a much better alternative." The first part was, of course, just to humor my friends who were complaining about men, but the second part is true. A person can leave, cheat, be unattainable, be cold and heartless, hurt you and walk away, or leave behind too many regrets. But as long as those sweet moments existed, the place where those memories were made will always remain. Whenever you long to return to those lost times, you can always go back to that city, that place that once made you so happy. The city bears witness to it all. Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Oxford, Hong Kong — these are the cities where I’ve lived and formed deep connections because of the people who walked into my life there. **Cities are eternal.** In the past, I said I sought out a man because he was the only one who truly saw my most authentic self. I was so honest and naive with him; all the details of my growth belonged to him alone. His understanding, support, and shared memories made him precious, sustaining the relationship even after the passion faded. Now I realize a city can do the same. **Cities are eternal.** Essentially, this is about an absolute pursuit of life experiences.

3. The bus circles around Hong Kong Island, we chat and hike further west in Kennedy Town; we didn’t get on the cable car due to the long queue at Victoria Peak; the crowded streets and bustling crowds in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, Wan Chai, and Causeway Bay; the Apple Stores in Pacific Place, Central, and IFC with the Vision Pro; the sea breeze on the Star Ferry... We're exploring Hong Kong.

4. To explore and embrace the uncertainty of a young life. I think it's unreasonable for me to prioritize stablity for the time being. As long as I haven't reach the upperbound of my ability, I need to try hard to lift my possibility frontier, widen my platform and broaden my horizon. Routine is boring.
