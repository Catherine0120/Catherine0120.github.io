This is the homepage of Shiying Zhang（张诗颖）, a sophomore undergraduate at Tsinghua University, majoring in [Computer Science and Finance (double bachelors degree)](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/jxjywj/bkzy2023/sxw/1.pdf). During my junior year, I'll be attending Oxford University as an exchange student, which is fully sponsored by the prestigious [Yinghua Scholarship](https://webvpn.tsinghua.edu.cn/http/77726476706e69737468656265737421fae0429e207e6b597d469dbf915b243d8ae9128e1cdcffb247/jwcbg/detail_cat.jsp?boardid=57&seq=8720). During that time, I plan to take courses in Economics and Computer Science to gain a deeper understanding of the European paradigm of classical and modern Economics, expand my horizons, and gradually build up my knowledge of the world. (and of course to travel around European countries at the same time!)

As a dual-degree student, I have a strong interest in Computer Science, Economics and Finance. I like the interpretation and insight of the world and human behavior in Economics, the ingenuity of computer engineering and the rigor of mathematical logic, and the complex game of the financial world and constant discussion about time value of money. These give me two distinct but complementary paradigms of thinking about the world, which I believe will have a long-term impact on my life.

At the same time, I am also an energetic person who lust for life and am eager for novel experiences. Till my sophomore year, I have participated in multiple internships, two research periods, multiple competitions, and won the Tsinghua Overall-Merit Scholarship for academic in year 2021-2022. On campus, I served as department leader of SEM SU, member of CST SAST, class monitor, and leader of CST Debate Team. I have also participated in Cricket Match, Cheerleading Contest and various debate competitions. In my freshman year, I was honored to be awarded the best debater of the year. Outside of school, I am active in various club organizations and travel around the world to interact with people from inside and outside the industry.

I value all unique experiences and strive to stay active in life and explore my own unique path.

In Michaelmas term at Oxford, I took International Economics, Money and Banking and Machine Learning. Meanwhile, I'm very fortunate to be offered the summer internship at Goldman Sachs (Hong Kong), which I'll be joining in June 2024.

I travelled around Europe during the Christmas vacation between Michaelmas and Hilary term. Here is my schedule:

> 12.3-12.9 Scotland (Glasgow, Oban, Skye/Inverness, Edinburgh)
> **France + Monaco**
> 12.9-12.11 Lyon
> 12.11-12.14 Nice + Cannes + Monaco
>   12.12 Cannes
>   12.13 Moncaco
> **Spain**
> 12.14-12.17 Barcelona
> 12.17-12.19 Madrid
> **Portugal**
> 12.19-12.21 Lisbon
> **Italy + Vatican**
> 12.21-12.24 Rome + Vatican
> 12.24-12.26 Florence
> 12.26-12.27 Milan
> **Switzerland**
> 12.27-12.29 Geneva
> 12.29 Bern
> 12.29-12.31 Interlaken (Jungfrau)
> 12.31 Lucerne
> 12.31-1.2 Zurich
> **France (again)**
> 1.2-1.5 Paris
>   1.4 Varseille

Total: 34 days, 8 countries, 22 cities, with 8 friends in total 

This is my first time travelling around Europe, self-planned and self-guided, for such a long time. I literally went to every corner of western Europe, from the northernmost point of Scotland to the southernmost point of Spain, from the westernmost point of Portugal to the easternmost point of Switzerland. Many sites and cities have left a deep impression on me, where I spent time exploring, city-walking, interacting with local people, and learning about the local culture. 

You can find my travel diary [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzk0MTYyMTczNg==&mid=2247483929&idx=1&sn=d21710137ca953c7632d12bf3760207e&chksm=c2ceea9ef5b9638861f36799013c71ee7a7cf3515b9c07eb126d96365d981b5925a5e0f885f2&token=795516037&lang=zh_CN#rd).

Currently, I'm back to Oxford and am taking courses in Economics and Computer Science. I'll take Macroeconomics and Game Theory for Economics, and Deep Learning for Healthcare for Computer Science this term.

The summer break between my sophomore and junior year. Here is my schedule:

> **2023 Summer Timetable**
> 6.22(Thu) - 6.25(Sun)：【北京 => **上海**】上海招生
> 6.26(Mon) - 7.8(Sat)：【上海 => **北京**】1字班军训
> 7.12(Tue) - 8.3(Thu)：【北京 => **上海**】信弘天禾QR实习
> 8.5(Sat) - 8.17(Thu)：【上海 => 北京 => **西雅图**】计算机系实践
> 8.22(Tue) - 8.25(Fri)：【西雅图 => 北京 => **秦皇岛**】阿那亚度假
> 8.28(Mon) - 9.22(Fri)：【秦皇岛 => **北京**】淡水泉投研实习
> 9.24(Mon) - 9.28(Sat): 【北京 => **上海**】回SHS + stay with yy
> 9.26(Tue)：【上海 => **北京** => 上海】面试（当日往返）
> 10.1(Sun)：【上海 => 伦敦 => **牛津**】交换 at Oxford

I thought this schedule is really fantastic for me. For one thing, I'm always interested in Quant-related job and am excited to have the opportunity to intern at XHTH, a 10 billion RMB AUM quant hedge fund. For another, I'm also curious about the comparison between traditional hedge fund and quant hedge fund, and I'm eager to learn more about the industry. Spring Capital, the top industry player, would offer me this opportunity. 

Furthermore, this summer inits a new chapter of my college life -- with key idea: the **exploration of the world**. I'll be going to Seattle, the city of Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks, to explore the American culture and investigate into these IT giants. I'll also be going to Oxford, the city of the oldest university in the English-speaking world, to explore the European culture and academically, how they teach Economics. As well, Beijing and Shanghai are two cities I'm always familiar with. It's time to cherish the time with my friends and family here before saying a brief goodbye to them.
