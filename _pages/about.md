This is the homepage of Shiying Zhang（张诗颖）, a sophomore undergraduate at Tsinghua University, majoring in Computer Science and Finance (double bachelors degree). During my junior year, I'll be attending Oxford University as an exchange student, which is fully sponsored by the prestigious Yinghua Scholarship. During that time, I plan to take courses in economics and computer science to gain a deeper understanding of the European paradigm of classical and modern economics, expand my horizons, and gradually build up my knowledge of the world. (and of course to travel around European countries at the same time!)

As a dual-degree student, I have a strong interest in computers, economics and finance. I like the interpretation and insight of the world view and human behavior in economics, the ingenuity of computer engineering and the rigor of mathematical logic, and the complex game of the financial world and constant discussion about time value of money. These give me two distinct but complementary paradigms of thinking about the world, which I believe will have a long-term impact on my life.

At the same time, I am also an energetic person who lusts for life and is eager for novel experiences. As of my sophomore year, I have participated in multiple internships, two research periods, multiple competitions, and won the overall merit scholarship for academic year 2021-2022. On campus, I served as department leader of SEMSU, member of CST_SAST, class monitor, and leader of CST Debate Team. I have also participated in Cricket Match, Cheerleading Contest and various debate competitions. In my freshman year, I was honored to be awarded the best debater of the year. Outside of school, I am active in various club organizations and travels around the world to interact with people from inside and outside the industry.

I value all unique experiences and strive to stay active in life and explore my own unique path.
