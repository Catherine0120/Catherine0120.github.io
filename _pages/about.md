<br />
This is the homepage of Shiying (Catherine) Zhang（张诗颖）, a final-year undergraduate at Tsinghua University, majoring in [Computer Science and Technology + Economics and Finance (double bachelors degree)](https://ug.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/bkjbkxm/jsjyjr.htm). During my junior year, I exchanged at University of Oxford, which was fully sponsored by the prestigious [Yinghua Scholarship](https://goglobal.tsinghua.edu.cn/yinghuascholars).

As a dual-degree student, I have a deep passion for Computer Science, Economics, and Finance. I am fascinated by the insights Economics offers into human behavior and the world, the ingenuity behind computer engineering, the rigor of mathematical logic, and the dynamic challenges of the financial markets. Together, these fields provide me with two distinct yet complementary ways of thinking that I believe will profoundly shape my future. In terms of my career, I aspire to work at a hedge fund, where I can apply both my quantitative and fundamental analytical skills to guide decision-making and contribute to innovative solutions within the financial sector.

I am energetic and passionate about embracing diverse life experiences. I have lived in Shenzhen (my birthplace), Shanghai (my hometown), Beijing (my university), Oxford (my exchange year), and Hong Kong (my internship), and have travelled in 25 countries. By the time of my graduation, I will have completed seven internships, two research projects, participated in multiple competitions, and earned several scholarships (including a National Scholarship). On campus, I served as the department leader of SEM SU, a member of CST SAST, class monitor, and leader of the CST Debate Team. I enjoy debating (having been awarded best debater in my freshman year), poker (representing Oxford in a UK poker competition), cricket, squash, skiing, and playing the piano (ABRSM Grade 8).
