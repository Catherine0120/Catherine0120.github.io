Here, you may find out some notes I took in Markdown format during my study at Tsinghua University.

## Econometrics

I took Econometrics(1) (Grade: A) taught by Prof [LIANGJUN SU](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1206/32089.htm) during my first semester of my sophomore year and took Econometrics(2) (Grade: A+) taught by Prof [SAINAN JIN](https://www.tioe.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1179/2211.htm) during my second semester of my sophomore year. Students are allowed to take paged of cheatsheet for the exams for these courses. So my cheatsheet are showned below which I believe contain the complete structure and important details of the courses.
