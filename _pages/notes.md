Here, you may find out some notes I took in Markdown format during my study at Tsinghua University.

## Econometrics

I took Econometrics(1) (Grade: A) taught by Prof [LIANGJUN SU](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1206/32089.htm) during my first semester of my sophomore year and took Econometrics(2) (Grade: A+) taught by Prof [SAINAN JIN](https://www.tioe.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1179/2211.htm) during my second semester of my sophomore year. Students are permitted to use a cheatsheet during exams for these courses. Therefore, I have prepared my cheatsheet below, which I believe encompasses the comprehensive structure and essential details of the course content.

## Investment

I took Investment (Grade: A) taught by Prof [YINGZI ZHU](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1207/31884.htm) during my second semester of my sophomore year. This note is a summary of the key ideas of the course and it really helped a lot during my review for the final exam.
